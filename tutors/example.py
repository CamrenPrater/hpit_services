#The tutor interacts with HPIT by submitting transaction request
#Tutors send messages in the form of JSON, consisting of two parameters:
#   name: string -- A period delimited name for the message.
#   payload: Object -- The message payload.
#Specialized web APIs can be built on top of this architecture later on.
